<h1>Hi, I'm Alfonso</h1>

Hi, I'm Alfonso Caio Espino, a 13-year-old 7th grader with a passion for coding. I taught myself the basics of front-end web development and earned my [Responsive Web Design](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/Alfonsoce11/responsive-web-design) certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I'm excited to continue learning advanced front-end and back-end web development, Python, and more. I attend Goleta Valley Junior High, where I play trumpet in the beginner band and also enjoy playing soccer. I'm also involved in Science Olympiad. Outside of school, I love modern yoyoing and speedcubing.
